This is just a few cogs I've written for [appu's selfbot](https://github.com/appu1232/Discord-Selfbot).

## Cogs:
- color.py - A somewhat better color displayer. Links to a website for color codes, colorblindness simulation, complimentary colors, etc...
- inspire.py - Generate and display a random inspirational pic from Inspirobot. Garunteed to lift your spirits.
